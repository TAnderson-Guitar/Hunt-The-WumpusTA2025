27/5/2025 - Set up the repo for the Hunt the Wumpus project. 
Spent some time learning about the origial 1973 games. 
Created the cave class document and wrote the first attributes (Name and description)
30/5/2025 - Write the main.py orogram to call the class and make the first cave object.
Modified the attributes to set up name on initialisation
Wrote setter and getter methods for each attribute. Started planning the layout of the caves.
2/6/2025 - Wrote a dictoinary attribute to store the links to other cave objects.
Wrote and tested a method to prin the linked_caves dictionary to the terminal.
3/6/2025 -  Added code to the main program to allow the player to move between different cave objects.
Set up new character class and test program. 
Created 'Harry - The smelly Wumpus' in test program and tested the conversation method.
4/06/2025 - Created the Enemy subclass of the parent class "Character". 
Slight modifications made to the testing gounds "char_test" to allow us to fight Harry
Made the Enemy subclass contain a fight function which allows the player to fight with the Wumpus
Made us able to set the weakness for the Enemy as well as die from him.
6/06/2025 - Finished testing the character in the char_test.py file. 
Added harry object into the main program and added it to the dungeon object. 
Reworked the main loop to report if a character is in a cave.
Added more code to the main loop to accept diffrent inputs (moving, talking and fighting) - still need to finish the code to manage fighting.
10/06/2025 - Finished the Tutorial for the Hunt the Wumpus code, Added 3 lines of code for a graceful exit
Created my new ideas for the next things to add to the project. My aim of the game is to escape from the english staffroom while also setting up capa
Throughout the game we will get the chance to go to either the hall or the carpark to complete the setup of capa.
